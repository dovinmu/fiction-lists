## Hugo eligibility

Eligibility for Nominations

Works published in 2021 for the first time anywhere are eligible for the Hugo Awards being awarded in 2022. So are works published for the first time in English translation in 2021, or for the first time in the United States in 2021, unless they have already appeared on a Hugo Award final ballot.

Books are considered to have been published in the year of the publication date, which usually appears with the copyright information on the back of the title page. If there is no stated publication date, the copyright date will be used instead. A dated periodical is considered to have been published on the cover date, regardless of when it was placed on sale or copyrighted. Serialized stories or dramatic presentations are eligible in the year in which the last installment appears.

Nominations may be relocated to a different category by the Hugo administrator if they are within 20% of the category boundary (such as in the case of Novel/Novella, Novella/Novelette, Novelette/Short Story, and Dramatic Presentation, Long Form/Dramatic Presentation, Short Form).

For full eligibility rules, please see the [WSFS Constitution](http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WSFS-Constitution-as-of-December-18-2021.pdf).

For detail on works whose eligibility was extended by the DisCon III Business Meeting, please see the full printable ballot available at https://chicon.org/home/whats-happening/hugo-awards/.
